# Ideally, for each primitive, we should think about cases such as:
# - Parameter values: negative, 0, 1, possible maximums (e.g. 1E38)
# - same input twice (e.g. distance to self)
# Different network configurations:
# - empty networks
# - partially disconnected networks
# - completely disconnect networks
# - Directed vs. undirected networks
#   - using undirected primitives with directed networks
#   - using directed versions of primitives on undirected networks
# For primitives using weights:
# - non numeric weights
# - negative weights

# Ideally, for each primitive, we should think about cases such as:
# - Parameter values: negative, 0, 1, possible maximums (e.g. 1E38)
# - same input twice (e.g. distance to self)
# Different network configurations:
# - empty networks
# - partially disconnected networks
# - completely disconnect networks
# - Directed vs. undirected networks
#   - using undirected primitives with directed networks
#   - using directed versions of primitives on undirected networks
# For primitives using weights:
# - non numeric weights
# - negative weights

# Note:
# undirected-edges/edge and directed-edges/edge refer to undirected and directed breeds, respectively.
# Note that is-directed-link? / is-undirected-link? do not check breed identity,
# but rather whether the particular links are directed or undirected, regardless of
# breed membership

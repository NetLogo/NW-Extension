    description: """
Reports the content of the current graph context as a list containing two agentsets: the agentset of turtles that are part of the context and the agentset of links that are part of the context.

Let's say we start with a blank slate and the default context consisting of `turtles` and `links`, `nw:get-context` will report a list the special `turtles` and `links` breed agentsets:

```NetLogo
observer> clear-all
observer> show nw:get-context
observer: [turtles links]
```

If we add some turtles and links to our context, we'll still see the same thing, even though `turtles` and `links` have internally grown:

```NetLogo
observer> crt 2 [ create-links-with other turtles ]
observer> show nw:get-context
observer: [turtles links]
```

If you had set your context to normal agentsets instead (built with `turtle-set`, `link-set` or `with`) here is what you would see:

```NetLogo
observer> clear-all
observer> nw:set-context turtle-set turtles link-set links
observer> show nw:get-context
observer: [(agentset, 0 turtles) (agentset, 0 links)]
```

If you then create new turtles and links, they are not added to the context because normal agentsets don't grow (see [Special agentsets vs normal agentsets](#special-agentsets-vs-normal-agentsets)):

```NetLogo
observer> crt 2 [ create-links-with other turtles ]
observer> show nw:get-context
observer: [(agentset, 0 turtles) (agentset, 0 links)]
```

But if you construct new agentsets and set the context to them, your new agents will be there:

```NetLogo
observer> nw:set-context turtle-set turtles link-set links
observer> show nw:get-context
observer: [(agentset, 2 turtles) (agentset, 1 link)]
```

If you want to see the actual content of your context, it is easy to turn your agentsets into lists that can be nicely displayed. Just use a combination of [`map`](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#map) and [`sort`](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#sort):

```NetLogo
observer> show map sort nw:get-context
observer: [[(turtle 0) (turtle 1)] [(link 0 1)]]
```

Finally, you can use `nw:get-context` to store a context that you eventually want to restore:

```NetLogo
extensions [ nw ]
to store-and-restore-context
  clear-all
  crt 2 [
    set color red
    create-links-with other turtles with [ color = red ] [
      set color yellow
    ]
  ]
  crt 2 [
    set color blue
    create-links-with other turtles with [ color = blue ] [
      set color green
    ]
  ]
  nw:set-context turtles with [ color = red ] links with [ color = yellow ]
  show map sort nw:get-context
  let old-turtles item 0 nw:get-context
  let old-links item 1 nw:get-context
  nw:set-context turtles with [ color = blue ] links with [ color = green ]
  show map sort nw:get-context
  nw:set-context old-turtles old-links
  show map sort nw:get-context
end
```

Here is the result:

```NetLogo

Reports the [local clustering coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient#Local_clustering_coefficient) of the turtle. The clustering coefficient of a node measures how connected its neighbors are. It is defined as the number of links between the node's neighbors divided by the total number of possible links between its neighbors.

`nw:clustering-coefficient` takes the directedness of links into account. A directed link counts as a single link whereas an undirected link counts as two links (one going one-way, one going the other).

The [global clustering coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient#Global_clustering_coefficient) measures how much nodes tend to cluster together in the network in general. It is defined based on the types of triplets in the network. A triplet consists of a central node and two of its neighbors. If its neighbors are also connected, it's a closed triplet. If its neighbors are not connected, it's an open triplet. The global clustering coefficient is simply the number of closed triplets in a network divided by the total number of triplets. It can be calculated from the local clustering coefficient quite easily with the following code

```NetLogo
to-report global-clustering-coefficient
  let closed-triplets sum [ nw:clustering-coefficient * count my-links * (count my-links - 1) ] of turtles
  let triplets sum [ count my-links * (count my-links - 1) ] of turtles

Note that the above will only work with the default context, and may need to tweaked if you've set the turtles or links in the network to something other than `turtles` and `links`.

A few things to notice:

- The breed is stored as data field, both for nodes and edges.
- The data includes both NetLogo's internal variables and the variables that were defined as either `breeds-own`, `turtles-own`, `linkbreeds-own` or `links-own`.
- Each key gets an `attr.type` based on the actual types of the values contained in the agent variables. The three possible types are `"string"`, `"double"` and `"boolean"`. To determine the attribute type of a particular agent variable, the extension will look at the first agent in the graph. To see which agent is first, you can look at the result of `nw:get-context`. Note that variables containing other types of values, such as turtles, patches, lists, etc., will be stored as strings.
- This example only has a directed link, and you will notice the `<graph edgedefault="directed">` element. If we had only undirected links, we would have `<graph edgedefault="undirected">`. What if we try to mix both kinds of link? At the moment, the extension will save such a "mixed" graph as if it were an undirected graph (see [this issue](https://github.com/NetLogo/NW-Extension/issues/58) for more details). The order of the `source` and `target` will be respected, however, so if you know which breeds represent directed links, you can figure it out _a posteriori_.

Loading a GraphML file into NetLogo with the network extension should be as simple as calling `nw:load-graphml "example.graphml"`, but there is a bit of preparation involved.

The key idea is that `nw:load-graphml` will try to assign the attribute values defined in the GraphML file to NetLogo agent variables of the same names (this is *not* case sensitive). The first one it tries to set is `breed` if it is there, so the turtle or link will get the right breed and, hence, the right breed variables.

One special case is the `who` number, which is ignored by the importer if it is present as a GraphML attribute: NetLogo does not allow you to modify this number once a turtle is created and, besides, there could already be an existing turtle with that number.

The simplest case to handle is when the original GraphML file has been saved from NetLogo by using `nw:save-graphml`. In this case, all you should have to do is to make sure that you have the same breed and variables definition as when you saved the file and you should get back your original graph. For example, if you want to load the file from the `nw:save-graphml` example above, you should have the following definitions:

```NetLogo
breed [ bankers banker ]
bankers-own [ bank-name ]
breed [ clients client ]
clients-own [ hometown ]

undirected-link-breed [ friendships friendship ]

directed-link-breed [ accounts account ]
accounts-own [ amount ]
```

Loading a graph that was saved from a different program than NetLogo is quite possible as well, but it may take a bit of tinkering to get all the attribute-variable match up right. If you encounter major problems, please do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/NetLogo/NW-Extension/issues/new).

The extension will try to assign the type defined by `attr.type` to each variable that it loads. If it's unable to convert it to that type, it will load it as a string. If `attr.type` is not defined, or is set to an unknown value, the extension will first try to load the value as a double, then try it as a boolean, and finally fall back on a string.

If you specify an _optional-command-block_, it is executed for each turtle in the newly created network. For example:

```NetLogo
nw:load-graphml "example.graphml" [ set color red ]
```

Note that this command block can be used to build a list or an agentset containing the newly created nodes:

```NetLogo
let node-list []
nw:load-graphml "example.graphml" [
  set node-list lput self node-list
]
let node-set turtle-set node-list

Limitations:

- Multigraphs are not supported in importing. Even if the file format supports it (and many don't), only the first link will be used on import. This is due to a limitation in the parsing libraries NW uses. `nw:load-graphml` does support multigraphs with the normal NetLogo limitation that two turtles can share more than one link only if all the links are of different breeds.

Limitations:

- `x` and `y` (not `xcor` and `ycor`) can only be numbers. `x` and `y` are commonly used in formats pertaining to position and behind the scenes NW uses Gephi's libraries for exporting. Furthermore, `x` and `y` will be added even if they didn't exist in the model. Again, this is because NW uses Gephi's libraries which assume that nodes have positions stored in `x` and `y`. If you wish to export to Gephi specifically, we recommend creating `x` and `y` turtles variables and setting them to `xcor` and `ycor` before export.
- Color will be exported in a standard RGB format. This should hopefully increase compatibility with other programs.
- Turtle and link variables that contain values of different types will be stored as strings. Unfortunately, most network formats require that node and attributes have a single type.
- Many programs use `label` to store the id of nodes. Thus, if you're having trouble importing data exported from NetLogo into another program, you might try setting turtles' labels to their `who` number.
- Multigraphs are not supported. Thus, two turtles can share at most one link. `nw:save-graphml` does support multigraphs, so use that if turtles can have more than one type of link connecting them.

`nw:save` determines the file-type of the given file based on the extension and calls the corresponding `save-*` primitive on it. Note that GraphML must be exported with `nw:save-graphml`.

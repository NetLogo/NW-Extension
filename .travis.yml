# extensions for 5.0.x are supposed to support Java 5 and 6,
# but Travis doesn't offer Oracle JDK 5 or 6.  so Travis won't
# catch it if we do something that only works on Java 7.
# oh well.  (we could try openjdk6, which Travis does have?
# it didn't work for the full NetLogo build, but might work
# for this.)
